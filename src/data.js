    desc: `One for the more recent developments in road bike genres is gravel bikes. Gravel bikes
     can tackle off road terrain such as tracks and trails whilst still retaining the ability to
      cover long rides relatively quickly. On first sight a gravel bike looks similar to a cyclocross 
      bike, however the geometry of a gravel bike is more designed for comfort, rather than the more
       aggresive geometry of a cyclocross bike.
    Gravel bikes combine the some of the comfort aspects of a sportive bike with some of the off road
     capabilities of a cyclo cross bike. The result is a bike which is comfy enough to be ridden all day
      and tackle all but the most extreme terrain, where mountain bikes still rule.
    Most gravel bikes feature disc brakes and a strong well built frame which can handle the additional 
    knocks and challenges these bikes are designed for. Larger clearances at the fork and rear stays allow
     for wider, more knobblier tyres and the debris which they can collect.
    Entry – Mid range gravel bikes tend to feature an aluminium frame combined with a carbon fibre front
     fork. Higher specced gravel bikes feature a carbon fibre frame and fork. Regardless of their construction
      material, gravel frames tend to be built more solidly than regular road bike frames.
    The drawback to all this extra in-built flexibility is a slight reduction in speed, however this 
    can be marginal and a price worth paying for a ‘go anywhere bike’.`,

     on endurance rather than speed.
    Sportive / Endurance bikes offer a lot of the lightweight benefits of a traditional race bike but 
    with one crucial point in mind – comfort.
    The riding position is more upright offering greater all-day comfort at the expense of aerodynamic 
    efficiency.
    The geometry of the frame is also tweaked to offer comfort and more stable/steadier handling over
     longer distances.
    The material make-up of Sportive bikes tends to be different from pure race models. The tubes are
     designed to ‘give’ a little bit. Less stiff, more comfy.
    Gearing is lower to help cope with big hills without the need for speed. Wheels are still lightweight
     but more robust and with little in terms of aerodynamic properties.
    Disc brakes and larger clearances (for wider tyrers )are also becoming more popular in this type of 
    bike.
    Finishing kit is more about comfort but again still light enough to not affect overall weight.
    In short, a sportive / endurance bike is a more comfortable race bike. Consider one if head down all out

    Most of these types of frame are carbon with the same geometry and material lay up as a race frame so expect

    While mountain bikers are used to mud, gravel bikers face a different challenge. Anyone who has ridden on a wet gravel road is familiar with the mixture of fine sand and water that seems to be designed especially to seek and destroy bearings, not to mention what it does to your eyes on a long ride.
    
    The Mudder Mini is here to offer relief for your face and headset bearing. Simply mount it to your fork legs just above your front tire and you will dramatically reduce the amount of spray in the critical areas. The MUDDER Mini attaches with innovative adjustable anti-slip straps to guarantee an instant and perfect fit on all fork sizes.
